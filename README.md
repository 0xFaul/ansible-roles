# Ansible roles

Here are some Ansible roles I have built for my own use.

- Requires Ansible 2.x
- Expects Debian 8 hosts

## Letsencrypt

Create a Letsencrypt cert with the help of the [acme-tiny](https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny) script. Includes a cron script for automatic renewal. Read more on my blog post [Let's Encrypt my servers with acme tiny](https://xdeb.org/node/1614).
